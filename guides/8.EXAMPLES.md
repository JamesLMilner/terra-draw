# Examples

This section provides a list of examples of projects using Terra Draw:

* [terradraw.io](https://github.com/JamesLMilner/terra-draw-website) - the official Terra Draw website. Uses Terra Draw extensively for all drawing modes.
* [S2 Demo](https://github.com/bdon/s2js-demos) - s2js is a Javascript port of the s2 spherical geometry library. This demo demonstrates drawing using the rectangle and polygon modes and returning the underlying s2 segements.
* [Orama Demo](https://github.com/askorama/examples/tree/main/examples/geosearch-airports) - uses Orama's geosearch capabiliti, where the user can draw a polygon and return the underlying airports in real time.
