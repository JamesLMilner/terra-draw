# Modes

Modes are another important concept in Terra Draw, they encapsulate specific logic for creating, selecting and rendering Features on the map. Modes can be categorised into three types:

- [Drawing Modes](#drawing-modes)
- [Selection Mode](#selection-mode)
- [Render Mode](#render-mode)

Once added to Terra Draw upon instantiation, they and can be enabled by calling the `setMode` method on the Terra Draw instance and providing the Mode Name.

## Mode Names

The `mode` property, set on all classes extending `TerraDrawBaseMode` is used to identify the Mode by a name when enabling or switching Modes. For example, the `TerraDrawPolygonMode` has the Mode Name `polygon`.

All Modes have built-in Mode Names, with the exception of `TerraDrawRenderMode` which is provided a custom name upon instantiation. For example:

```javascript
const draw = new TerraDraw({
  adapter: new TerraDrawLeafletAdapter({ lib, map }),
  modes: [
    // Polygon Mode has the built-in name "polygon"
    new TerraDrawPolygonMode(),

    // Render Modes are given custom names
    new TerraDrawRenderMode({
      modeName: "ourmodename",
    }),
  ],
});

draw.start();
```

The Mode Name is also added to the `properties` object of the GeoJSON Feature that is created when a Mode is used to draw a feature.

For example, if you draw a polygon using the `TerraDrawPolygonMode` the `mode` property on the GeoJSON Feature will be set to `polygon` like so:

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {
        "mode": "polygon"
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [
          [
            [-1.82645, 51.17888],
            [-1.826208, 51.179025],
            [-1.825859, 51.178867],
            [-1.82609, 51.178682],
            [-1.82645, 51.17888]
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> When [Loading Data](#loading-features) into Terra Draw, the `mode` property is used to determine which Mode to add the Feature to.

### Switching Modes

You can swap to any given mode using it's name once we have instantiated and started our Terra Draw instance. For example, let's say we want to start in 'polygon' mode then later on switch to point mode, we could do that like so:

```javascript
draw.setMode('polygon')

// Later on...

draw.setMode('point')
```

### Mode Types

Modes can have one of four types. Drawing modes are associated with drawing new geometries onto the map, select modes are aassociated with selecting existing geometries on the map, static mode is a builtin inert mode that just renders the geometries to the map, and a render mode is a 'view only' mode that is just for rendering geometries to the map.

```typescript
export enum ModeTypes {
	Drawing = "drawing",
	Select = "select",
	Static = "static",
	Render = "render",
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, you may only have one `select` mode instantiated in anyone Terra Draw instance.

### Drawing Modes

Terra Draw comes with the following built-in Drawing Modes out of the box:

| Mode         | Class                                                                                                       | Name          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Circle       | [TerraDrawCircleMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawCircleMode.html)           | `circle`      |
| Freehand     | [TerraDrawFreehandMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawFreehandMode.html)       | `freehand`    |
| Great Circle | [TerraDrawGreatCircleMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawGreatCircleMode.html) | `greatcircle` |
| Line         | [TerraDrawLineStringMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawLineStringMode.html)   | `linestring`  |
| Point        | [TerraDrawPointMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawPointMode.html)             | `point`       |
| Polygon      | [TerraDrawPolygonMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawPolygonMode.html)         | `polygon`     |
| Rectangle    | [TerraDrawRectangleMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawRectangleMode.html)     | `rectangle`   |

### Selection Mode

The Selection Mode is used to select Features that have been drawn on the map.

| Mode   | Class                                                                                             | Name     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Select | [TerraDrawSelectMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawSelectMode.html) | `select` |

The Selection Mode allows for the manipulation of selected Features. The editing of Features is enabled on a per-Mode basis through the `flags` property upon instantiation.

For example, to enable editing of Features in the `TerraDrawPolygonMode`:

```javascript
const selectMode = new TerraDrawSelectMode({
  flags: {
    polygon: {
      feature: {
        // The entire Feature can be moved
        draggable: true,

        // Individual coordinates that make up the Feature...
        coordinates: {
          // Can be added
          midpoints: true,

          // Can be moved
          draggable: true,

          // [Requires draggable to be true] allow resizing of the geometry from 
          // a given origin. Center fixed will allow resizing on fixed aspect ratio from the center
          // and opposite-corner-fixed allows resizing from the opposite corner of the bounding box 
          // of the geometry.
          resizeable: 'center-fixed', // can also be 'opposite-corner-fixed'

          // Can be deleted
          deletable: true,
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

The following code sample shows the different Selection Mode flags available when instantiating the `TerraDrawSelectMode`:

```javascript
new TerraDrawSelectMode({
  // Allow manual deselection of features
  allowManualDeselection: true, // this defaults to true - allows users to deselect by clicking on the map

  // Enable editing tools by Feature
  flags: {
    // Point
    point: {
      feature: {
        draggable: true,
      },
    },

    // Polygon
    polygon: {
      feature: {
        draggable: true,
        coordinates: {
          midpoints: true,
          draggable: true,
          deletable: true,
        },
      },
    },

    // Line
    linestring: {
      feature: {
        draggable: true,
        coordinates: {
          midpoints: true,
          draggable: true,
          deletable: true,
        },
      },
    },

    // Freehand
    freehand: {
      feature: {
        draggable: true,
        coordinates: {
          midpoints: true,
          draggable: true,
          deletable: true,
        },
      },
    },

    // Circle
    circle: {
      feature: {
        draggable: true,
        coordinates: {
          midpoints: true,
          draggable: true,
          deletable: true,
        },
      },
    },

    // Rectangle
    rectangle: {
      feature: {
        draggable: true,
        coordinates: {
          midpoints: true,
          draggable: true,
          deletable: true,
        },
      },
    },

    // Great Circle
    greatcircle: {
      feature: {
        draggable: true,
        coordinates: {
          midpoints: true,
          draggable: true,
          deletable: true,
        },
      },
    },
  },

  // Styles go here...
  styles: {
    // See Styling Guide for more information
  },
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> It is possible to create and use your own selection mode if you so wish. You do not have to use the built in select mode (`TerraDrawSelectMode`).


#### Getting Selected Features

You can get selected features from the selection mode in one of two ways. The first is to listen for the `select` event:

```typescript
draw.on('select', (id: string) => {
  const snapshot = draw.getSnapshot()

	// Search the snapshot for the selected polygon
	const polygon = snapshot.find((feature) => feature.id === id)
})
```

Alternatively, if you need access to the specific mouse/map event alongside the selected geometry you can achieve this in almost all map libraries by creating an event on the map itself object itself like so:

```typescript
// Register an on click event onto the map itself
map.on('click', (event) => {
	const snapshot = draw.getSnapshot()

	// Search the snapshot for the selected polygon
	const polygon = snapshot.find((feature) => feature.properties.selected === true && feature.geometry.type === 'Polygon')

	// If there is not a selected polygon, don't do anything
	if (!polygon) {
		return
	}

	// Else create or update the popup location to be the cursor position!
	if (popup) {
		popup.setLngLat([event.lngLat.lng, event.lngLat.lat])
	} else {
		popup = new maplibregl.Popup({ closeOnClick: false })
			.setLngLat([event.lngLat.lng, event.lngLat.lat])
			.setHTML('<h1>Example Popup</h1>')
			.addTo(map);
	}
})
```


### Render Mode

The Render Mode is used to render Features that have been drawn on the map, but are not editable.

| Mode   | Class                                                                                             | Name                                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Render | [TerraDrawRenderMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawRenderMode.html) | Unique name provided on instantiation through the `modeName` property |

Render Modes are instantiated like so:

```javascript
const renderMode = new TerraDrawRenderMode({
  // Unique Mode Name used to identify the Mode (required)
  modeName: "ourmodename",
});
```

> [!TIP]
> Multiple Render Modes can be added to the Terra Draw instance. This allows you to style indiviual Render Modes differently. See the [Styling](./5.STYLING.md#render-mode) guide for more information.

## Adding Modes

Modes are added to Terra Draw upon instantiation through the `modes` property like so:

```javascript
const draw = new TerraDraw({
  adapter: new TerraDrawLeafletAdapter({ lib, map }),
  modes: [
    // Polygon Mode has the built-in name "polygon"
    new TerraDrawPolygonMode(),

    // Freehand Mode has the built-in name "freehand"
    new TerraDrawFreehandMode(),
  ],
});

draw.start();
```

## Enabling Modes

Once added, Modes can be enabled by calling the `setMode` method on the Terra Draw instance and providing the Mode Name:

```javascript
// Once we have started Terra Draw
draw.start();

// Enable the TerraDrawPolygonMode
draw.setMode("polygon");

// Switch to the TerraDrawFreehandMode
draw.setMode("freehand");
```

> [!TIP]
> Render Modes are enabled by default and do not need to be enabled using the `setMode` method.

## Adding Data to a Mode

For guidance around adding pre-existing data to a specific mode, please see the [Store guide on adding features](./2.STORE.md#adding-data).

## Creating Custom Modes

See the [Development](./6.DEVELOPMENT.md) guide for more information on creating custom Modes.
