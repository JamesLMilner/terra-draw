 # Store

The Store is the heart of the library and is responsible for managing the state of all Features that are added to the map. The Store is created when Terra Draw is instantiated, but is not directly exposed, and instead exposed via a series of API methods on the Terra Draw instance itself. All data in the store is represented using [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON). Currently the store only represents data as Features, using the Point, LineString and Polygon geometry types.

### Retrieving Data

The data contained with the store is exposed via the `getSnapshot` method, which returns an Array of all given Feature geometries in the Store:

```javascript
// Get an Array of all Features in the Store
const features = draw.getSnapshot();
```

We can then filter through this array to get the features we're looking for, as an example only returning `TerraDrawPolygonMode` features:

```javascript
features.filter((feature) => feature.properties.mode === 'polygon')
```

### Adding Data

Features are added to the Store when interacting with the Map using a number of available drawing Modes (such as `TerraDrawRectangleMode` or `TerraDrawPolygonMode`).

> [!TIP]
> The `getSnapshot` method returns a deep copy of the Store, so you can safely mutate the returned Array without affecting the Store.

Features can also be added to the Store programmatically using the `addFeatures` method:

```javascript
// Add a Point to the Store
draw.addFeatures([
  {
    type: "Feature",
    geometry: {
      type: "Point",
      coordinates: [-1.825859, 51.178867],
    },
    properties: {
      mode: "point",
    },
  },
]);
```

Here setting the mode property will add the feature to that specific mode, so for example in this instance we added a point to the `TerraDrawPointMode` of this instance of Terra Draw.

We can also get data at a specific event location, using the `getFeaturesAtLngLat` and `getFeaturesAtPointerEvent` methods. Find out more about these in the [events section of the guides](./6.EVENTS.md).

### Removing Data

To remove Features from the Store use the `removeFeatures` or `clear` methods:

```javascript
// Remove Feature from the Store by ID
draw.removeFeatures(["id-1", "id-2", "id-3"]);

// Remove all Features from the Store
draw.clear();
```

See the `TerraDraw` [API Docs](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDraw.html) for more information.

## Restoring Data 

Terra Draw is agnostic to how you want to presist the data created with it. You can store data in a remote database, in [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API), [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), or any other storage mechanism you so wish. As a simple example of storing the data in `localStorage`, you could take a snapshot and restore it a later date like so:

```javascript
const features = draw.getSnapshot()

// We don't want any mid points or selection points so we filter them out
const filteredFeatures = features.filter((f) => !f.properties.midPoint && !f.properties.selectionPoint)

// localStorage can only store strings, so we strinify the features first
localStorage.setItem('terra-draw-data', JSON.stringify(filteredFeatures));

// Later on, perhaps after the user has refreshed.
const retrievedFeatures = localStorage.getItem('terra-draw-data');
if (retrievedFeatures) {
  draw.setFeatures(JSON.parse(retrievedFeatures))
}
```
