# Events

Terra Draw has a number of ways to interact with it, including:

- Responding to native mouse/pointer Events
- Responding to Terra Draw Events

## Native Events

### Getting Features From A Mouse/Pointer Event

Getting features at a given mouse event can be done like so:

```typescript
document.addEventListener("mousemove", (event) => {
  const featuresAtMouseEvent = draw.getFeaturesAtPointerEvent(event, {
    // The number pixels to search around input point
    pointerDistance: 40,

    // By default polygons are only considered at the location if they are directly selected
    // this option allows them to be returned if they are within the pointer distance 
    includePolygonsWithinPointerDistance: true,

    // Ignore features that have been selected
    ignoreSelectFeatures: true,

    // ignore coordinates
    ignoreCoordinatePoints: true,

    // Ignore the current feature if one is being drawn
    ignoreCurrentlyDrawing: true,

    // Ignore closing points 
    ignoreClosingPoints: true,

    // Ignore snapping points 
    ignoreSnappingPoints: true,

    // Adds to feature's properties information about the closest coordinate to pointer event
    addClosestCoordinateInfoToProperties: true

  });

  // Do something with the features...
  console.log({ featuresAtMouseEvent });
});
```

### Getting Features At A Given Longitude/Latitude

Getting features at a given longitude and latitude can be done like so:

```typescript
map.on("mousemove", (event) => {
  const { lng, lat } = event.lngLat;
  const featuresAtLngLat = draw.getFeaturesAtLngLat(
    { lng, lat },
    {
      // The number pixels to search around input point
      pointerDistance: 40,

      // Ignore features that have been selected
      ignoreSelectFeatures: true,
    },
  );
  console.log({ featuresAtLngLat });
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> The second argument is optional for both `getFeaturesAtPointerEvent` and `getFeaturesAtLngLat`, with defaults set to `ignoreSelectFeatures: false` and `pointerDistance: 30`.

### Ignoring Mismatched Targets For Pointer Down/Up Events 

By default in Terra Draw, if you put the pointer down outside and of the map element and then release inside it, the `onClick` callback will still be called for the current mode. For example if you are in TerraDrawPointMode, you put the pointer down outside the map element (say a sidepanel) then release the inside the map element, it will trigger the onClick event in the point mode and create a point. You can avoid this by passing `ignoreMismatchedPointerEvents: true` to your adapter. This will mean onClick would not get called in this scenario and not point would be created.


## Terra Draw Events

There are a number of Terra Draw events that you can listen to. For example, you can add a callback function that is invoked when Terra Draw has completed editing a Feature:

```typescript
draw.on("change", (ids, type) => {
  //Done editing
  if (type === "delete") {
    // Get the Store snapshot
    const snapshot = draw.getSnapshot();

    // Do something
    //...
  }
});
```

If you are interested if the event was triggered by the Terra Draw API (i.e. `addFeatures`, `removeFeatures`), there is a third optional parameter ('context') that will have a property called origin, which is of type `api` if it has come from the API.


```typescript
draw.on("change", (ids, type, context) => {
  //Done editing
  if (type === 'change') {
    if (context?.origin === 'api') {
      console.log('this was changed via the API!')
    } else if (context?.origin === undefined) {
      console.log('this change did not originate from the API!')
    }
  }
});
```

You can check if properties or geometry was updated for the features in question by checking the `target` property of the context:

```typescript
draw.on("change", (ids, type, context) => {
  if (type === 'change') {
    if (context?.target === 'properties') {
      console.log('properties were changed')
    } else if (context?.target === 'geometry') {
      console.log('geometry was changed')
    }
  }
});
```

The other Terra Draw events are:

```typescript
draw.on("finish", (id: string, context: { action: string, mode: string }) => {
  if (context.action === 'draw') {
    // Do something for draw finish event
  } else if (context.action === 'dragFeature') {
    // Do something for a drag finish event
  } else if (context.action === 'dragCoordinate') {
    //
  }else if (context.action === 'dragCoordinateResize') {
    //
  }
});

draw.on("change", (ids: string[], type: string) => {
  // Possible type values:
  // 'create'
  // 'update'
  // 'delete'
  // 'styling'
  // Do something
  //...
});

draw.on("select", (id: string) => {
  // Do something
  //...
});

draw.on("deselect", () => {
  // Do something
  //...
});
```
