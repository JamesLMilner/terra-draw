# E2E Testing with Playwright

We provide a basic end-to-end (E2E) via Playwright, testing against the Leaflet Adapter

## Installation

Installation can be down via npm like so:

```shell
npm install
```

## Running

You can run the tests headless (i.e. no opening of Chromimum) like so:

```shell
npm run test
```

Or you can run them headed (i.e. Chromimum will open and you will see the tests run) like so:

```shell
npm run test:headed
```
