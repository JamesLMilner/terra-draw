# Modes

Modes are another important concept in Terra Draw, they encapsulate specific logic for creating, selecting and rendering Features on the map. Modes can be categorised into three types:

- [Drawing Modes](#drawing-modes)
- [Selection Mode](#selection-mode)
- [Render Mode](#render-mode)

Once added to Terra Draw upon instantiation, they can be enabled by calling the `setMode` method on the Terra Draw instance and providing the Mode Name.

## Mode Names

The `mode` property, set on all classes extending `TerraDrawBaseMode`, is used to identify the Mode by a name when enabling or switching Modes. For example, the `TerraDrawPolygonMode` has the Mode Name `polygon`.

All Modes have built-in Mode Names, with the exception of `TerraDrawRenderMode` which is provided a custom name upon instantiation. For example:

```javascript
const draw = new TerraDraw({
  adapter: new TerraDrawLeafletAdapter({ lib, map }),
  modes: [
    // Polygon Mode has the built-in name "polygon"
    new TerraDrawPolygonMode(),

    // Render Modes are given custom names
    new TerraDrawRenderMode({
      modeName: "ourmodename",
    }),
  ],
});

draw.start();
```

The Mode Name is also added to the `properties` object of the GeoJSON Feature that is created when a Mode is used to draw a feature.

For example, if you draw a polygon using the `TerraDrawPolygonMode` the `mode` property on the GeoJSON Feature will be set to `polygon` like so:

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {
        "mode": "polygon"
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [
          [
            [-1.82645, 51.17888],
            [-1.826208, 51.179025],
            [-1.825859, 51.178867],
            [-1.82609, 51.178682],
            [-1.82645, 51.17888]
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> When [Loading Data](#loading-features) into Terra Draw, the `mode` property is used to determine which Mode to add the Feature to.

### Switching Modes

You can swap to any given mode using its name once we have instantiated and started our Terra Draw instance. For example, let's say we want to start in 'polygon' mode then later on switch to point mode, we could do that like so:

```javascript
draw.setMode('polygon')

// Later on...

draw.setMode('point')
```

### Mode Types

Modes can have one of four types. Drawing modes are associated with drawing new geometries onto the map; select modes are associated with selecting existing geometries on the map; static mode is a built-in inert mode that just renders the geometries to the map, and a render mode is a 'view only' mode that is just for rendering geometries to the map.

```typescript
export enum ModeTypes {
	Drawing = "drawing",
	Select = "select",
	Static = "static",
	Render = "render",
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, you may only have one `select` mode instantiated in anyone Terra Draw instance.

### Drawing Modes

Terra Draw comes with the following built-in Drawing Modes out of the box:

| Mode         | Class                                                                                                       | Name          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Circle       | [TerraDrawCircleMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawCircleMode.html)           | `circle`      |
| Freehand     | [TerraDrawFreehandMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawFreehandMode.html)       | `freehand`    |
| Freehand LineString     | [TerraDrawFreehandLineStringMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawFreehandLineStringMode.html)       | `freehand-linestring`    |
| Line         | [TerraDrawLineStringMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawLineStringMode.html)   | `linestring`  |
| Point        | [TerraDrawPointMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawPointMode.html)             | `point`       |
| Polygon      | [TerraDrawPolygonMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawPolygonMode.html)         | `polygon`     |
| Rectangle    | [TerraDrawRectangleMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawRectangleMode.html)     | `rectangle`   |
| Angled Rectangle    | [TerraDrawRectangleMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawAngledRectangleMode.html)     | `angled-rectangle`   |
| Sector    | [TerraDrawSector](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawSectorMode.html)     | `sector`   |
| Sensor    | [TerraDrawSensor](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawSensorMode.html)     | `sensor`   |

#### Validation in Drawing Modes

All built in drawing modes have a base level of validation that runs when a feature is added programmatically i.e. addFeatures (see the [store guide](./2.STORE.md) for more details).  This attempts to prohibit adding corrupt or invalid data to the mode. Terra Draw works on the assumption that features created on the mode are correct to the validation built-in standard. As an end developer we can also take this a step further, by using the `validation` property available on all built in modes. `validation` simply takes a function that returns `true` if the Feature is valid or `false` if it is not. You can write any logic you require to validate the geometry. For example, let's say we wanted to ensure all drawn polygons did not self intersect, we could something like this:

```typescript
polygonMode = new TerraDrawPolygonMode({
  validation: (feature, { updateType }) => {
    if (updateType === "finish" || updateType === "commit") {
      return ValidateNotSelfIntersecting(feature);
    }
    return { valid: true }
  }
});
```

This would stop the user from being able to create a polygon that is self intersecting. Here we use `ValidateNotSelfIntersecting` which is exposed as a Validation from Terra Draw. At the moment Terra Draw exposes 3 built in validations:

- `ValidateMinAreaSquareMeters` - Ensures that a draw Polygon is a minimum size in square meters
- `ValidateMaxAreaSquareMeters` - Ensures that a draw Polygon is a maximum size in square meters
- `ValidateNotSelfIntersecting` - Ensures that a draw Polygon or LineString is does not self intersect

You can combine these validations if you so wish. Any `validation` function will be run as part of `validateFeature` which is called by `addFeatures` on the public Terra Draw API/.

You'll notice there are two arguments to the `validation` function, the first being the feature, the second being the context object. This has useful properties which can help with performing the validation. One of the most useful properties is the `updateType` property which tells you what type of update the feature is receiving, where the options are `finish`, `commit` or `provisional`.

- `finish` - when the drawing of the feature is being finished
- `commit` - when a coordinate has been added or removed from the feature
- `provisional` - when the geometry has been update, but the coordinate has not been fully committed to the geometry

Using these can help you write more customised behaviours, for example you may only want to run the validation when the update is a `finish` or `commit` type, ensuring that validation is not prematurely preventing user interactions to update the feature.

#### Snapping

Some specific modes support snapping, currently polygon, linestring and select mode. As of writing you can snap between features in the same mode. Currently polygon mode supports snapping to a the coordinates or line segments of existing features via the `toCoordinate` and/or `toLine` properties respectively:

```typescript
  new TerraDrawPolygonMode({
    snapping: {
      toLine: true,
      toCoordinate: true,
    },
    validation: (feature, { updateType }) => {
      if (updateType === "finish" || updateType === "commit") {
        return ValidateNotSelfIntersecting(feature);
      }
      return { valid: true };
    },
  })
```

We can also provide a `toCustom` function which allows snapping to some arbitrary position. This could be other features in the store, or some external data you have access too synchronously:

```typescript
  new TerraDrawPolygonMode({
    snapping: {
      toCustom: () => {
        // You can return whatever position you want here, determined in any way you see fit!
        return [0, 0] 
      }
    }
  })
```

In `TerraDrawSelectMode` we can similarly add snapping behaviours like so:

```typescript
new TerraDrawSelectMode({
  projection: "web-mercator",
  flags: {
    polygon: {
      feature: {
        coordinates: {
          snappable: {
            toLine: true,
            toCoordinate: true
          },
        }
      }
    },
    linestring: {
      feature: {
        coordinates: {
          snappable: {
            toLine: true,
            toCoordinate: true
          },
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

#### Updating a Modes Options After Instantiation

If we want to dynamically change an option passed to a mode after it has been instantiated we can do this using the `updateModeOptions` method. It is used in the following way:

```typescript
draw.updateModeOptions<typeof TerraDrawPolygonMode>('polygon', {
  snapping: {
    toLine: false,
    toCoordinate: true
  }
})
```

Here we can pass a partial object with the options we want to update. In the case above we are just updating the snapping option. This functionality can be used to change how your modes work on the fly.

#### Identifying Currently Drawn Features

For builtin modes (modes provided by Terra Draw directly), we specify a property `currentlyDrawing` that identifies features that are currently being drawn. This can be used to style the drawn feature in a specific way like so:

```typescript
new TerraDrawPolygonMode({
  styles: {
    fillColor: ({ properties }) => properties.currentlyDrawing ? "#33c9dd" : "#3777dd",
  },
}),
```

#### Projections in Drawing Modes

As we move forward Terra Draw will work on supporting Web Mercator maps out the box with the ability to support Globes (i.e., 3D spherical representations of the earth with no projection) as a secondary option. This is made slightly more complicated by the fact we know sometimes users want to draw geodesic geometries on a web mercator map, for example a geodesic circle or a great circle line. In future we will better align by assuming developers want web mercator first behaviours, with secondary support for globes via the `projection` property for built in modes.

* Circle mode currently supports both web mercator and geodesic circles, using the `projection` property, which can be `globe` or `web-mercator` (default is `web-mercator`)
* Select mode currently supports both web mercator and geodesic editing (scaling, rotating), although `resizable` property currently only supports `web-mercator` as `projection` (default is `web-mercator`)

Note: If you want to draw great circle lines on a web mercator map, this is possible. Historically there was a specific mode called 'TerraGreatCircleMode' however this was deprecated in favour of supporting it directly in `TerraDrawLineStringMode`. You can achieve the same effect, by using the `projection` property and setting it to `globe` and using the `insertCoordinates` property in conjunction with it, like so: 

```typescript
		new TerraDrawLineStringMode({
			projection: 'globe',
			insertCoordinates: {
				strategy: 'amount',
				value: 10
			}
		}),
```

#### Touch Device Support

All modes work with keyboard and mouse interface. 

There are varying degrees of support for touch devices. Currently on touch devices Select, Point, Line and Polygon Modes are fully supported. Circle, Rectangle and Angled Rectangle Modes work with the caveat with the UX is not ideal. Freehand is not currently supported. Currently on [terradraw.io](terradraw.io]) Circle, Rectangle and Freehand modes are disabled on smaller devices. 

If you want to experiment you can use the local Storybook environment, as described in the [Storybook package](https://github.com/JamesLMilner/terra-draw/blob/main/packages/storybook/README.md).


### Selection Mode

The Selection Mode is used to select Features that have been drawn on the map.

| Mode   | Class                                                                                             | Name     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Select | [TerraDrawSelectMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawSelectMode.html) | `select` |

The Selection Mode allows for the manipulation of selected Features. The editing of Features is enabled on a per-Mode basis through the `flags` property upon instantiation.

For example, to enable editing of Features in the `TerraDrawPolygonMode`:

```javascript
const selectMode = new TerraDrawSelectMode({
  flags: {
    polygon: {
      feature: {
        // The entire Feature can be moved
        draggable: true,

        // Individual coordinates that make up the Feature...
        coordinates: {
          // Midpoint be added 
          midpoints: {
            // Midpoint be dragged
            draggable: true
          },

          // Can be moved
          draggable: true,

          // Can snap to other coordinates from geometries _of the same mode_
          snappable: true,

          // Allow resizing of the geometry from a given origin. 
          // center will allow resizing of the aspect ratio from the center
          // and opposite allows resizing from the opposite corner of the 
          // bounding box of the geometry. 
          resizable: 'center', // can also be 'opposite', 'center-fixed', 'opposite-fixed'

          // Can be deleted
          deletable: true,

          // Provide a custom validation that will run when we attempt to edit the geometry
          validation: (feature, context) => {

              // context has the methods project and unproject and be used to go from screen space 
              // to geographic space and vice versa

              // ValidateMinAreaSquareMeters can be imported from Terra Draw
					    return ValidateMinAreaSquareMeters(feature.geometry, 1000);
          }
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

The following code sample shows the different Selection Mode flags available when instantiating the `TerraDrawSelectMode`:

```javascript
new TerraDrawSelectMode({
  // Allow manual deselection of features
  allowManualDeselection: true, // this defaults to true - allows users to deselect by clicking on the map

  // Enable editing tools by Feature
  flags: {
    // Point
    point: {
      feature: {
        draggable: true,
      },
    },

    // Polygon
    polygon: {
      feature: {
        draggable: true,
        coordinates: {
          midpoints: true,
          draggable: true,
          deletable: true,
        },
      },
    },

    // Line
    linestring: {
      feature: {
        draggable: true,
        coordinates: {
          midpoints: true,
          draggable: true,
          deletable: true,
        },
      },
    },

    // Freehand
    freehand: {
      feature: {
        draggable: true,
        coordinates: {
          midpoints: true,
          draggable: true,
          deletable: true,
        },
      },
    },

    // Circle
    circle: {
      feature: {
        draggable: true,
        coordinates: {
          midpoints: true,
          draggable: true,
          deletable: true,
        },
      },
    },

    // Rectangle
    rectangle: {
      feature: {
        draggable: true,
        coordinates: {
          midpoints: true,
          draggable: true,
          deletable: true,
        },
      },
    },

  },

  // Styles go here...
  styles: {
    // See Styling Guide for more information
  },
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> It is possible to create and use your own selection mode if you so wish. You do not have to use the built in select mode (`TerraDrawSelectMode`).


#### Getting Selected Features

You can get selected features from the selection mode in one of two ways. The first is to listen for the `select` event:

```typescript
draw.on('select', (id: string) => {
  const snapshot = draw.getSnapshot()

	// Search the snapshot for the selected polygon
	const polygon = snapshot.find((feature) => feature.id === id)
})
```

Alternatively, if you need access to the specific mouse/map event alongside the selected geometry you can achieve this in almost all map libraries by creating an event on the map itself object itself like so:

```typescript
// Register an on click event onto the map itself
map.on('click', (event) => {
	const snapshot = draw.getSnapshot()

	// Search the snapshot for the selected polygon
	const polygon = snapshot.find((feature) => feature.properties.selected === true && feature.geometry.type === 'Polygon')

	// If there is not a selected polygon, don't do anything
	if (!polygon) {
		return
	}

	// Else create or update the popup location to be the cursor position!
	if (popup) {
		popup.setLngLat([event.lngLat.lng, event.lngLat.lat])
	} else {
		popup = new maplibregl.Popup({ closeOnClick: false })
			.setLngLat([event.lngLat.lng, event.lngLat.lat])
			.setHTML('<h1>Example Popup</h1>')
			.addTo(map);
	}
})
```

### Selecting and Deselecting Features Programmatically

It is possible to select and deselect a feature via the draw instance, which uses the provided select mode under the hood. Here is an example of how you can use the draw instance methods to perform selection and deselection.

```typescript
  const draw = new TerraDraw({
    adapter,
    modes: [
      new TerraDrawPointMode(),
      new TerraDrawSelectMode({
        flags: {
          point: {
            feature: { draggable: true },
          },
        },
      }),
    ],
  });

  draw.start();

  // Add feature programmatically
  const result = draw.addFeatures([
    {
      id: "f8e5a38d-ecfa-4294-8461-d9cff0e0d7f8",
      type: "Feature",
      geometry: {
        type: "Point",
        coordinates: [-25.431289673, 34.355907891],
      },
      properties: {
        mode: "point",
      },
    },
  ]);

  // Log out if the feature passed validation or not
  if (!result[0].valid) {
    throw new Error(result.reason ? result.reason : 'Feature f8e5a38d-ecfa-4294-8461-d9cff0e0d7f8 was invalid')
  }

  // Select a given feature
  draw.selectFeature("f8e5a38d-ecfa-4294-8461-d9cff0e0d7f8");
 
  // Deselect the given feature
  draw.deselectFeature("f8e5a38d-ecfa-4294-8461-d9cff0e0d7f8");
 
```
### Editable Features

Some modes support the concept of features being editable via the `editable` option . You can think of editable as a lightweight version of the select mode without having to switch into select mode directly. Users can do light edits to geometries they have already created, for example dragging existing coordinates. Currently three modes support the editable option: `TerraDrawPointMode`, `TerraDrawLineStringMode` and `TerraDrawPolygonMode`.

Enabling it is straight forward and can be done like so:

```typescript
new TerraDrawPolygonMode({ editable: true }),
```

### User Interactions and Pointer Distance

There are certain situations when a user is using Terra Draw, where the library needs to be able to determine if an interaction was intended to cause a specific event or not. For example:

* When selecting a geometry, Terra Draw needs to know if a click was just intended for the underlying map, or to select a given geometry
* When trying to close a geometry by it's closing point, or if a new coordinate was intended to be drawn on the geometry.

This cut off point is determined by what is called the 'pointer distance'. Pointer distance is measured in pixels and provides the buffer around an already drawn coordinate that would be considered a closing/select event or not. That is to say pointer down events within that pointer distance buffer would be considered a closing or selection event when trying to draw or select respectively. This pointer distance can be configured for features by the `pointerDistance` option, and defaults to 40px. You can configure it like so:

```typescript
new TerraDrawPolygonMode({ pointerDistance: 25 }), 
```

### Render Mode

The Render Mode is used to render Features that have been drawn on the map, but are not editable.

| Mode   | Class                                                                                             | Name                                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Render | [TerraDrawRenderMode](https://jameslmilner.github.io/terra-draw/classes/TerraDrawRenderMode.html) | Unique name provided on instantiation through the `modeName` property |

Render Modes are instantiated like so:

```javascript
const renderMode = new TerraDrawRenderMode({
  // Unique Mode Name used to identify the Mode (required)
  modeName: "ourmodename",
});
```

> [!TIP]
> Multiple Render Modes can be added to the Terra Draw instance. This allows you to style individual Render Modes differently. See the [Styling](./5.STYLING.md#render-mode) guide for more information.

## Adding Modes

Modes are added to Terra Draw upon instantiation through the `modes` property like so:

```javascript
const draw = new TerraDraw({
  adapter: new TerraDrawLeafletAdapter({ lib, map }),
  modes: [
    // Polygon Mode has the built-in name "polygon"
    new TerraDrawPolygonMode(),

    // Freehand Mode has the built-in name "freehand"
    new TerraDrawFreehandMode(),
  ],
});

draw.start();
```

## Enabling Modes

Once added, Modes can be enabled by calling the `setMode` method on the Terra Draw instance and providing the Mode Name:

```javascript
// Once we have started Terra Draw
draw.start();

// Enable the TerraDrawPolygonMode
draw.setMode("polygon");

// Switch to the TerraDrawFreehandMode
draw.setMode("freehand");
```

> [!TIP]
> Render Modes are enabled by default and do not need to be enabled using the `setMode` method.

## Adding Data to a Mode

For guidance around adding pre-existing data to a specific mode, please see the [Store guide on adding features](./2.STORE.md#adding-data).

## Checking if the User is Drawing

Sometimes it can be useful to know if the user is currently drawing or not so you can do something based on this information. You can achieve this like so:

```typescript
// Once we have started Terra Draw
draw.start();

// Enable the TerraDrawPolygonMode
draw.setMode("polygon");

// Determine if the user is currently drawing or not - either 'started' or 'drawing'
const state = draw.getModeState();
```

## Filtering Pointer Events in Modes

There are times when a click or tap, and the corresponding behaviour may be undesirable for a given reason. For the built-in modes (i.e. modes provided in the `terra-draw` module) it is possible to filter out these pointer events, which can be achieved like so:

```typescript
new TerraDrawPolygonMode({
    pointerEvents: {
        rightClick: true,
        contextMenu: true,
        leftClick: (event) => {
            if (event.lat < 5) {
                console.log('event is triggered in the mode')
                return false
            }

            console.log('event is not triggered in the mode)
            return true;
        },
        onDragStart: true,
        onDrag: true,
        onDragEnd: true,
    }
})
```

In this case we are putting in a arbitrary reason to filter, where if the click occurs at latitude less than 5 we do not count the click. You can put any logic you so wish here, even potentially performing your own logic instead when the event is filtered.

## Creating Custom Modes

See the [Development](./7.DEVELOPMENT.md) guide for more information on creating custom Modes.
