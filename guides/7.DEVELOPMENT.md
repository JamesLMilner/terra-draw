# Development

How to develop the Terra Draw project locally.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Folder Structure

- `.github` - used for all GitHub related configuration such as the GitHub Actions work flows
- `.husky` - used to storing the precommit hooks that are used on the project
- `src` - source files for the project
- `dist` - the bundled distributed files of the project
- `docs` - the demo app that is published to GitHub pages
- `guides` - learn how to use Terra Draw
- `development` - the local development app that is used for developing locally (see below)
- `common` - code that is used across `development` and `docs` folder

## Technologies Used

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - provides strong compile time typing for JavaScript
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - used for testing (see more information below)
- microbundle - used for the production bundle
- Webpack - used for bundling locally in development (`development` and `docs` folders)
- esno - for running tests quickly without type checking

## Building the Project

To build the project, you will need to install the dependencies from the project root:

```shell
npm install
```

You can then build the project using:

```shell
npm run build
```

You can also create a watching build that detects changes and rebuilds the project automatically:

```shell
npm run serve
```

## Adapter Interface

In theory an adapter could be created for any mapping library that can fill out the Adapter abstract class (`TerraDrawBaseAdapter`).

For example, in the `LeafletAdapter` we create and update a GeoJSON layer that Leaflet knows how to render to the screen.

Assuming that an adapter extends from `TerraDrawBaseAdapter`, these methods would need to be implemented:

```typescript
public project(...args: Parameters<Project>): ReturnType<Project>;

public unproject(
  ...args: Parameters<Unproject>
): ReturnType<Unproject>;

public setCursor(
  ...args: Parameters<SetCursor>
): ReturnType<SetCursor>;

public getLngLatFromEvent(event: PointerEvent | MouseEvent): {
  lng: number;
  lat: number;
} | null;

public setDraggability(enabled: boolean): void;

public setDoubleClickToZoom(enabled: boolean): void;

public getMapEventElement(): HTMLElement;

public render(
  changes: TerraDrawChanges,
  styling: TerraDrawStylingFunction
): void;
```

## Mode Anatomy

Modes are not just limited to drawing features, for example the built-in `TerraDrawSelectMode` allows for selection and editing of geometries that have previously been drawn. The `TerraDrawRenderMode` is a "view only" Mode useful for showing non-editable data alongside editable data in your application.

Assuming that a mode extends from `TerraDrawBaseMode`:

```typescript
/** @internal */
start() {
  this.setStarted();
}

/** @internal */
stop() {
  this.setStopped();
}

/** @internal */
onClick(event: TerraDrawMouseEvent) {}

/** @internal */
onMouseMove(event: TerraDrawMouseEvent) {}

/** @internal */
onKeyDown(event: TerraDrawKeyboardEvent) {}

/** @internal */
onKeyUp(event: TerraDrawKeyboardEvent) {}


/** @internal */
onDragStart(event: TerraDrawMouseEvent) {}

/** @internal */
onDrag(event: TerraDrawMouseEvent) {}

/** @internal */
onDragEnd(event: TerraDrawMouseEvent) {}

/** @internal */
styleFeature(feature: GeoJSONStoreFeatures): TerraDrawAdapterStyling {}
```

## Precommit Hooks

It is probably useful to be aware of the precommit hooks you will face when trying to run a git commit on the project. There are two currently in use, namely:

- Uses pre-commit hook to run lint rules (eslint/prettier) on code before commit.
- Uses pre-commit hook to ensure [conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) are used.

## Testing

Terra Draw uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as it's testing framework. You can distinguish a test by it's `.spec.ts` file name extension.

To run the tests as they would run in CI:

```shell
npm run test
```

You can also check the coverage by running:

```shell
npm run test:coverage
```

For local development you may benefit from the `nocheck` option which allows you to avoid running TypeScript type checking when running the tests. This option also only checks files which are explicitly tested (i.e. have a spec file.)

```shell
npm run test:nocheck
npm run test:nocheck:coverage
```

## Developing Locally

The `development/` directory contains an App that aims to make developing Terra Draw locally easier.

It allows you to run each mapping provider adapter in parallel, allowing for fast development and testing in the browser as you make changes. See the `development/`[README](../development/README.md) for more information.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute to Terra Draw, we request that you:

1. Make an issue on GitHub describing the bug you intend to fix or the feature you intend to add.
2. Create a fork of the project, and work on a branch that represents the issue.
3. Ensure that the work you have done is unit tested, aiming for 80% code coverage.
4. Create a PR that represents this work. Please refer to the issue from the PR.
5. We will address the PR and give you feedback.

Please note that we can not guarantee that all PRs will be merged. There are cases where a PR may deviate from the long-term vision for Terra Draw and hence we may have to decline it. Creating the issue in advance helps us discuss any potential issues upfront before the PR is made.

## Code of Conduct

We have a code of conduct which we expect individuals interacting with the project to respect. Please refer to the full [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
